_An analysis of the Television market with data from Bestbuy's online shop_

The Television market, despite existing for nearly a century, is still thriving. 2020 was a record year in terms of total market revenue, and it is forecast to grow by 10% per year through at least 2024†. However, the market landscape is fiercely competitive and a few brands from different countries vie for market-share dominance. There are also new market entrants from China (e.g. TCL, Hisense) quickly gaining ground.

Using Bestbuy.com's online retail data, this project seeked to gain insight on today's TV market landscape and customer purchasing behavior, useful to TV manufacturers in expansion of market-share.

Bestbuy is a specialty retailer focused on consumer electronics, and its online shop is considered the best platform for buying TVs (behind Amazon and Walmart, both of which do not specialize in electronics)†.
